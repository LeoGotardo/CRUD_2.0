## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install some external libraries. Navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies such as `tkinter`, `pymongo`, `PIL`, and `customtkinter`.

## Usage

To start the application, run the `View.py` script from the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python View.py
```

Follow the GUI prompts to log in, sign up, generate passwords, and manage your stored credentials.

## Features

- User authentication (login and signup)
- Password generation with customizable criteria (length, inclusion of numbers/symbols)
- Secure password storage and management
- GUI for easy interaction

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- pymongo
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- customtkinter
- alive_progress

## Configuration

No additional configuration is needed to run the application in its default state. Make sure to enter your MongoDB connection details in `Model.py` to connect to your database.

## Documentation

For more detailed information on how to use this application, refer to the inline comments within each script. The main components are:

- `View.py`: Contains the GUI and user interaction logic.
- `Model.py`: Handles database operations and password storage.
- `Controller.py`: Serves as an intermediary between the view and model.
- `PasswordGenerator.py`: Generates passwords based on given criteria.

## Examples

Here are some common actions you can perform with the application:

- **Generating a Password:** Navigate to the password generation section, select your criteria, and generate a strong password.
- **Adding a Login:** Store a new login by entering the site name, your username, and password.
- **Editing Credentials:** Update your stored credentials as needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting to MongoDB, ensure your connection string in `Model.py` is correct and that your database is accessible.
